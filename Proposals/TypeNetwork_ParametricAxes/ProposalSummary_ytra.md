# Proposal Summary Form: Y Transparent

This proposal describes a proposed Y Transparent axis as part of a proposed system of parametric and optical axes.

## Adminstrative Information

See details in [Type Network Parametric Axes Proposal Overview](Overview.md).

## General Technical Information

**Overview:** This describes a proposed Y Transparent axis to vary the vertical (y-direction) size of counters.

**Related axes:** [yopq](ProposalSummary_yopq.md) 

**Similar axes:** [xtra](ProposalSummary_xtra.md), [xopq](ProposalSummary_xopq.md), [ytra](ProposalSummary_ytra.md)

**Axis type:** Parametric

## Proposed Axis Details

**Tag:** ytra

**Name:** Y Transparent

**Description:** Assigns an overall “white” per-mille value to each instance.

**Valid numeric range:**  0 to 2000

**Scale interpretation:** Values should be interpreted as per-mille-of-em.

**Recommended or required “Regular” value:** N/A

**Suggested programmatic interactions:** Example: Program or script may choose to adjust
Y Transparent in order to change the height of glyphs to emphasize text or headline, fit
text to a space, stack and justify text.

**UI recommendations:** Users may choose to program a variant in connection to direct or
conjunctive input for a page description language, or via a user interface

**Script or language considerations:** Can be used for all scripts.

**Additional information:** Y Transparent changes the white space in the y, or vertical,
direction. Combined with other axes it contributes to optical size, height, and many
other possible options.

## Justification
